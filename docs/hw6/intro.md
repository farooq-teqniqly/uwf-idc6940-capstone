Introduction and Methods for
Capstone

Overview

This week, your task is to develop the Introduction and Methods sections
of your capstone project, which should focus on mathematical, statistical, or
data science concepts relevant to your research. These sections are fundamental
to your final report, laying the theoretical and practical foundations for your
project. Below are the specific guidelines for structuring your work.

Introduction

In the Introduction, you should frame the research problem in a mathematical,
statistical, or data science context. Be sure to include:

• Problem definition: Clearly articulate the research question or problem
you are addressing. Explain why this problem is significant within the
fields of mathematics, statistics, or data science.

• Context and background: Review relevant theories, mathematical
models, statistical techniques, or data science methodologies that inform
your project. Reference key research papers, algorithms, or theorems that
provide the foundation for your work.

• Objectives and goals: Define the specific objectives of your project.
What do you aim to accomplish or discover through your analysis or mod-
eling?

• Summary of approach: Provide a brief overview of the techniques, algo-
rithms, or mathematical models you plan to use. This will lead naturally
into the Methods section.

Methods

The Methods section should detail the technical approach and methodologies
you will employ. This section is critical for explaining how you plan to perform
your analysis or modeling. Be sure to include the following:

• Data acquisition and sources: Describe the datasets you will use, in-
cluding their origin, structure, and any preprocessing steps required (e.g.,
data cleaning, transformation, or feature engineering).

• Mathematical or statistical models: Clearly outline the models, algo-
rithms, or analytical frameworks you plan to implement (e.g., regression
models, machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, Monte Carlo
simulations). Specify why these models are appropriate for your research
question.

• Experimental design or analytical procedures: Provide a step-by-
step breakdown of your methodology, such as training machine learn-
ing models, performing hypothesis testing, or constructing mathematical
proofs. Include details on model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE,
AUC) or statistical significance tests (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals)
you plan to use.

• Software and tools: List the software (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, SAS)
and libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) that will

sources you plan to use, such as cloud computing or local clusters.

• Ethical considerations (if applicable): If your project involves sen-
sitive data or human subjects, include a brief discussion on how you will
ensure ethical use of data, privacy, or confidentiality.

the Introduction. If your methodology is already planned, focus more on the
technical details in the Methods section.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification

on what to include in these sections.
