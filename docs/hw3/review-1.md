Literature Review Guidance

Overview

As part of your literature review project, you are required to read
and analyze one peer-reviewed research papers relevant to your area
of study. The goal of this task is to deepen your understanding of the current
state of research in your field and to identify how existing work can inform and
support your upcoming capstone project.

Task Breakdown

1. Selection of Papers

• Choose one research papers that are directly related to your area of in-
terest and your anticipated capstone project. The paper should be from
reputable journals or conference proceedings.

• Ensure there is no overlap of selected papers within your group.
You must coordinate with your team members to confirm that everyone is
reviewing unique papers. Failure to ensure unique selections within your
group will result in a deduction of points.

2. Summary and Analysis

For each paper, provide a detailed summary that includes the following sections:

• Background/Motivation:

– Describe the context in which the research was conducted.

– What problem or gap in the existing literature does the paper aim

to address?

– Discuss the significance of the research question and why it is impor-

tant.

• Methods Used:

– Summarize the methodologies employed by the authors.

– Explain how these methods are suited to address the research ques-

tion.

– Discuss any innovative approaches or techniques that are particularly

noteworthy.

• Significance of the Work:

– Highlight the key findings and contributions of the paper.

– Explain why the results are important within the broader context of

the field.

– Discuss the implications of the findings for future research or practice.

• Connection to Other Work:

– Relate the paper to other relevant studies.

– How does this paper build on or differ from previous work?

– Identify any references to seminal works or influential papers cited

by the authors.

• Relevance to Capstone Project:

– Discuss how the content of the paper might be relevant to your own

capstone project.

– Identify any specific methods, theories, or findings that you might

incorporate into your project.

– Highlight any potential areas where your capstone could expand upon

or diverge from the paper’s findings.

3. Formatting and Submission

• Your summaries should be concise but thorough, with more than 1,000

words.

• Use proper academic writing standards, including citations and references

in APA or IEEE format.

• Submit your summaries as a single document via Canvas by the deadline.

• Enter your summary into a single document using Overleaf or your GitHub

Website, then export it as a single PDF for submission on Canvas.
