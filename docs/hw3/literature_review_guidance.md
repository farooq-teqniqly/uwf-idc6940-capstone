1. Introduction

Knowledge production within the ﬁeld of business research is accelerating at a tremendous speed while at the
same time remaining fragmented and interdisciplinary. This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to
be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business
research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature
reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a speciﬁc metho-
dology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This
paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and oﬀers an overview of diﬀerent
types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also
discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.

Building your research on and relating it to existing knowledge is
the building block of all academic research activities, regardless of
discipline. Therefore, to do so accurately should be a priority for all

Knowledge production within the ﬁeld of business research is accel-
erating at a tremendous speed while at the same time remaining frag-
mented and interdisciplinary. This makes it hard to keep up with state-
of-the-art research and to be at the forefront, as well as to assess the
collective evidence in a particular research area. This is why the lit-
erature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. A lit-
erature review can broadly be described as a more or less systematic
way of collecting and synthesizing previous research (Baumeister &
Leary, 1997; Tranﬁeld, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). An eﬀective and well-
conducted review as a research method creates a ﬁrm foundation for
advancing knowledge and facilitating theory development (Webster &
Watson, 2002). By integrating ﬁndings and perspectives from many
empirical ﬁndings, a literature review can address research questions
with a power that no single study has.

It can also help to provide an overview of areas in which the re-
search is disparate and interdisciplinary. In addition, a literature review
is an excellent way of synthesizing research ﬁndings to show evidence
on a meta-level and to uncover areas in which more research is needed,
which is a critical component of creating theoretical frameworks and
building conceptual models. However, traditional ways of describing
and portraying the literature often lack thoroughness and are not un-
dertaken systematically (Tranﬁeld et al., 2003). This results in a lack of

knowledge of what the collection of studies is actually saying or to what
it is pointing at. As a result, there is a great chance that authors build
their research on ﬂawed assumptions. When researchers are selective of
the evidence on which to build their research, ignoring research that
points the other way, serious problems can be faced. In addition, even
when the methodology of the reviews is valid, there are often issues
with what constitutes a good contribution.

integrative reviews

Of course, there already exist some guidelines for conducting lit-
erature reviews that suggest diﬀerent types of reviews, such as narrative
or
(e.g., Baumeister & Leary, 1997; Wong,
Greenhalgh, Westhorp, Buckingham, & Pawson, 2013), systematic re-
views, and meta-analysis (e.g., Davis, Mengersen, Bennett, & Mazerolle,
2014; Liberati et al., 2009; Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaﬀ, & Altman, 2009)
or integrative reviews (e.g., Torraco, 2005). There have also been some
attempts to develop guidelines speciﬁcally for business or management
research (e.g., Palmatier, Houston, & Hulland, 2018; Tranﬁeld et al.,
2003). By building on and synthesizing these diﬀerent types of litera-
ture reviews, this paper takes a broader view by summarizing and in-
tegrating the diﬀerent guidelines, including how to apply them in
business research. More speciﬁcally, the purpose of this paper is to
provide an overview of and guidelines for diﬀerent types of literature
reviews as a research method in businesses research.

In the following paper, it will be argued that the potential for
making theoretical and practical contributions using the literature re-
view as a method will be advanced by clarifying what a literature re-
view is, how it can be used, and what criteria should be used to evaluate
its quality. The paper has several contributions. First, this paper sepa-
rates between diﬀerent types of review methodologies; systematic,

semi-systematic and integrative approaches and argues that depending
on purpose and the quality of execution, each type of approach can be
very eﬀective. While systematic reviews have strict requirements for
search strategy and selecting articles for inclusion in the review, they
are eﬀective in synthesizing what the collection of studies are showing
in a particular question and can provide evidence of eﬀect that can
inform policy and practice. However, systematic reviews are not always
the best strategy. Instead, when wanting to study a broader topic that
has been conceptualized diﬀerently and studied within diverse dis-
ciplines, this can hinder a full systematic review process. Instead, a
semi-systematic review approach could be a good strategy for example
map theoretical approaches or themes as well as identifying knowledge
gaps within the literature. In some cases, a research question requires a
more creative collection of data, in these cases; an integrative review
approach can be useful when the purpose of the review is not to cover
all articles ever published on the topic but rather to combine perspec-
tives to create new theoretical models. Second, the current paper ad-
dresses practical issues that may be encountered when conducting a
literature review in business research. These issues, for example, can
relate to selecting the appropriate review methodology for the targeted
research question, deciding on eligibility criteria, determining appro-
priate boundaries for the review, choosing what data to extract from the
paper, or concluding what type of contribution should be made. Third,
this paper provides context and guidance to researchers seeking to use
the literature review as a method to synthesize research in their own
domains, to inform their own research, or to provide guidance for social
policy. Last, this paper also aims to provide some guidelines for how to
assess quality when evaluating review papers which hopefully will be
helpful to editors, reviewers, and authors, as well as to any reader of a
review paper.

2. Why you should write a literature review

Consideration of prior, relevant literature is essential for all research
disciplines and all research projects. When reading an article, in-
dependent of discipline, the author begins by describing previous re-
search to map and assess the research area to motivate the aim of the
study and justify the research question and hypotheses. This is generally
referred to as the “literature review,” “theoretical framework,” or “re-
search background.” However, for a literature review to become a
proper research methodology, as with any other research, follow proper
steps need to be followed and action taken to ensure the review is ac-
curate, precise, and trustworthy. As with all research, the value of an
academic review depends on what was done, what was found, and the
clarity of reporting (Moher et al., 2009). Depending on the purpose of
the review, the researcher can use a number of strategies, standards,
and guidelines developed especially for conducting a literature review.
Then, when should a literature review be used as a research method?
For a number of research questions, a literature review may be the
best methodological tool to provide answers. For example, reviews are
useful when the researcher wants to evaluate theory or evidence in a

certain area or to examine the validity or accuracy of a certain theory or
competing theories (Tranﬁeld et al., 2003). This approach can be
narrow, such as investigating the eﬀect of or relationship between two
speciﬁc variables, or it can be broader, such as exploring the collective
evidence in a certain research area. In addition, literature reviews are
useful when the aim is to provide an overview of a certain issue or
research problem. Typically, this type of literature review is conducted
to evaluate the state of knowledge on a particular topic. It can be used,
for example, to create research agendas, identify gaps in research, or
simply discuss a particular matter. Literature reviews can also be useful
if the aim is to engage in theory development (Baumeister & Leary,
1997; Torraco, 2005). In these cases, a literature review provides the
basis for building a new conceptual model or theory, and it can be
valuable when aiming to map the development of a particular research
ﬁeld over time. However, it is important to note that depending on the
goal of the literature review, the method that should be used will vary.

2.1. Diﬀerent approaches to conducting a literature review

As mentioned previously, there are a number of existing guidelines
for literature reviews. Depending on the methodology needed to
achieve the purpose of the review, all types can be helpful and appro-
priate to reach a speciﬁc goal (for examples, please see Table 1). These
approaches can be qualitative, quantitative, or have a mixed design
depending on the phase of the review. In the following, three broad
types of methods commonly used will be described, as summarized in
Table 2. The broad types that will be presented and discussed include
the systematic review, the semi-systematic review, and the integrative
review. Under the right circumstances, all of these review strategies can
be of signiﬁcant help to answer a particular research question. How-
ever, it should be noted that there are many other forms of literature
reviews, and elements from diﬀerent approaches are often combined.
As these approaches are quite wide, it should be noted that they might
require further adaptation for a particular research project.

2.1.1. Systematic literature review

What is it and when should we use it? Systematic reviews have fore-
most been developed within medical science as a way to synthesize
research ﬁndings in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible way
and have been referred to as the gold standard among reviews (Davis
et al., 2014). Despite all the advantages of this method, its use has not
been overly prevalent in business research, but it is increasing (e.g.,
Snyder, Witell, Gustafsson, Fombelle, & Kristensson, 2016; Verlegh &
Steenkamp, 1999; Witell, Snyder, Gustafsson, Fombelle, & Kristensson,
2016). A systematic review can be explained as a research method and
process for identifying and critically appraising relevant research, as
well as for collecting and analyzing data from said research (Liberati
et al., 2009). The aim of a systematic review is to identify all empirical
evidence that ﬁts the pre-speciﬁed inclusion criteria to answer a par-
ticular research question or hypothesis. By using explicit and systematic
methods when reviewing articles and all available evidence, bias can be

minimized, thus providing reliable ﬁndings from which conclusions can
be drawn and decisions made (Moher et al., 2009).

What type of analysis can be conducted? Often, but not always, sta-
tistical methods, such as the meta-analysis, are used to integrate the
results of the included studies. A meta-analysis is a statistical method of
combining results from diﬀerent studies to weigh and compare and to
identify patterns, disagreements, or relationships that appear in the
context of multiple studies on the same topic (Davis et al., 2014). With
the meta-analysis approach, each primary study is abstracted and
coded, and ﬁndings are subsequently transformed into a common me-
tric to calculate an overall eﬀect size (Glass, 1976). However, to be able
to perform a meta-analysis, the included studies must share statistical
measures (eﬀect size) to compare results (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986).
Therefore, it is challenging to perform a meta-analysis on studies with
diﬀerent methodological approaches (Tranﬁeld et al., 2003). Even
though the systematic review method was developed in medical sci-
ence, attempts have been made create guidelines within the social
sciences (Davis et al., 2014; Palmatier et al., 2018; Tranﬁeld et al.,
2003). In addition, there are several published meta-analyses in higher-
ranked business journals (Carrillat, Legoux, & Hadida, 2018; Chang &
Taylor, 2016). However, in these areas, which not are restricted to
randomized controlled trials, a major challenge lies in assessing the
quality of research ﬁndings. As a result, more qualitative approaches
have been developed to assess the quality and strength of ﬁndings from
diﬀerent types of studies and to compare results (Greenhalgh, Robert,
Macfarlane, Bate, & Kyriakidou, 2004). This is often referred to as a
qualitative systematic review, which can be described as a method of
comparing ﬁndings from qualitative studies (Grant & Booth, 2009).
That is, a strict systematic review process is used to collect articles, and
then a qualitative approach is used to assess them.

What is a potential contribution from a systematic review? There are
several advantages and potential contributions of conducting a sys-
tematic review. For example, we can determine whether an eﬀect is
constant across studies and discover what future studies are required to
be conducted to demonstrate the eﬀect. Techniques can also be used to
discover which study-level or sample characteristics have an eﬀect on
the phenomenon being studied, such as whether studies conducted in
one cultural context show signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results from those
conducted in other cultural contexts (Davis et al., 2014).

2.1.2. Semi-systematic review

What is it and how should it be used? The semi-systematic or narrative
review approach is designed for topics that have been conceptualized
diﬀerently and studied by various groups of researchers within diverse
disciplines and that hinder a full systematic review process (Wong et al.,
2013). That is, to review every single article that could be relevant to

the topic is simply not possible, so a diﬀerent strategy must be devel-
oped. There are several examples of articles using this approach pub-
lished in business journals (e.g., McColl-Kennedy et al., 2017). Besides
the aim of overviewing a topic, a semi-systematic review often looks at
how research within a selected ﬁeld has progressed over time or how a
topic has developed across research traditions. In general, the review
seeks to identify and understand all potentially relevant research tra-
ditions that have implications for the studied topic and to synthesize
these using meta-narratives instead of by measuring eﬀect size (Wong
et al., 2013). This provides an understanding of complex areas. How-
ever, while covering broad topics and diﬀerent types of studies, this
approach holds that the research process should be transparent and
should have a developed research strategy that enables readers to assess
whether the arguments for the judgments made were reasonable, both
for the chosen topic and from a methodological perspective.

What type of analysis can be conducted? A number of methods can be
used to analyze and synthesize ﬁndings from a semi-systematic review.
These methods often have similarities to approaches used in qualitative
research in general. For example, a thematic or content analysis is a
commonly used technique and can be broadly deﬁned as a method for
identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns in the form of themes
within a text (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Although this type of review is
usually followed by a qualitative analysis, there are exceptions. For
example, Borman and Dowling (2008) used a semi-structured method
of collecting literature but combined it with a statistical meta-analysis
approach.

What is a potential contribution from a semi-systematic review? This
type of analysis can be useful for detecting themes, theoretical per-
spectives, or common issues within a speciﬁc research discipline or
methodology or for identifying components of a theoretical concept
(Ward, House, & Hamer, 2009). A potential contribution could be, for
example, the ability to map a ﬁeld of research, synthesize the state of
knowledge, and create an agenda for further research or the ability to
provide an historical overview or timeline of a speciﬁc topic.

2.1.3. Integrative review

What is it and when should it be used? Closely related to the semi-
structured review approach is the integrative or critical review ap-
proach. In comparison to the semi-structured review, an integrative
review usually has a diﬀerent purpose, with the aim to assess, critique,
and synthesize the literature on a research topic in a way that enables
new theoretical frameworks and perspectives to emerge (Torraco,
2005). Although rare, examples of this type of review can be identiﬁed
in the business
literature (e.g., Covington, 2000; Gross, 1998;
Mazumdar, Raj, & Sinha, 2005). Most integrative literature reviews are
intended to address mature topics or new, emerging topics. In the case

transparency so readers can judge the quality of the review?

Phase 4: structuring and writing the review

of mature topics, the purpose of using an integrative review method is
to overview the knowledge base, to critically review and potentially re-
conceptualize, and to expand on the theoretical foundation of the
speciﬁc topic as it develops. For newly emerging topics, the purpose is
rather to create initial or preliminary conceptualizations and theoretical
models, rather than review old models. This type of review often re-
quires a more creative collection of data, as the purpose is usually not to
cover all articles ever published on the topic but rather to combine
perspectives and insights from diﬀerent ﬁelds or research traditions.

What type of analysis can be used? The data analysis part of an in-
tegrative or critical review is not particularly developed according to a
speciﬁc standard (Whittemore & Knaﬂ, 2005). However, while there is
no strict standard, the general aim of a data analysis in an integrative
review is to critically analyze and examine the literature and the main
ideas and relationships of an issue. It should be noted that this requires
researchers to have advanced skills, such as superior conceptual
thinking (MacInnis, 2011) at the same time as being transparent and
document the process of analysis.

What is a potential contribution from an integrative review? An in-
tegrative review method should result in the advancement of knowl-
edge and theoretical frameworks, rather than in a simply overview or
description of a research area. That is, it should not be descriptive or
historical but should preferably generate a new conceptual framework
or theory. Although an integrative review can be conducted in a
number of ways, researchers are still expected to follow accepted
conventions for reporting on how the study was conducted (Torraco,
2005). That is, how the integrative was done and how articles were
selected must be transparent. However, a note of caution. While well-
conducted integrative reviews can make a valid and strong contribution
to its ﬁeld of research, more often than the opposite, they either lack
transparency or true integration of research. Frequently, reviews la-
beled as integrative are simply summaries of studies and not truly in-
tegrative.

2.2. How to decide on what approach to use

While it can be challenging to determine what approach is most
appropriate for a speciﬁc type of review, the research question and

336

speciﬁc purpose of the review always determine the right strategy to
use. While the systematic review is perhaps the most accurate and
rigorous approach to collect articles, because there is certainty that all
relevant data have been covered, this approach requires a narrow re-
search question, and it might not be feasible or even suitable for all
types of projects. This is where the semi-systematic review can be
useful, but this approach is also more problematic and as it has fewer
clear steps to follow. While the methodology for systematic reviews is
straightforward and follows highly strict rules and standards (Liberati
et al., 2009), the semi-systematic review process requires more devel-
opment and tailoring to the speciﬁc project (Wong et al., 2013). Often,
researchers need to develop their own standards and a detailed plan to
ensure the appropriate literature is accurately covered to be able to
answer their research question and be transparent about the process.
However, if done properly, this can be a highly eﬀective way of cov-
ering more areas and broader topics than a systematic review can
handle. In addition, when it comes to the integrative review, it becomes
even more demanding, which puts more responsibility on and requires
more skills of the researchers, as there are even fewer standards and
guidelines on which to rely for developing a strategy (Torraco, 2005).
This leads to the notion that an integrative review approach might not
be advisable to use, and if compared to the systematic review, it might
not hold the same amount of rigor. However, if successfully conducting
a truly integrative review and contributing with a new conceptual
model or theory, the reward can be signiﬁcant (MacInnis, 2011).

3. The process of conducting a literature review

Independent of what approach will be used to conduct the literature
review, a number of steps that must be taken and decisions made to
create a review that meets the requirements for publication (for speciﬁc
considerations in relationship to each step. See Table 3). In the fol-
lowing, the basics steps and important choices involved in conducting a
literature review will be suggested and discussed using four phases; (1)
designing the review, (2) conducting the review, (3) analysis and (4)
writing up the review. This process was developed from practical ex-
perience and is a synthesis of and inﬂuenced by various standards and
guidelines suggested for literature reviews (e.g., Liberati et al., 2009;
Tranﬁeld et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2013).

3.1. Phase 1: designing the review

The ﬁrst question that should be asked is why this review should be
conducted. Is there really a need for a literature review in this area? If
so, what type of literature review would be the most helpful and would
make the greatest contribution? Of consideration should also be what
audience will most likely be interested in the review when deciding on
the topic. This is a relevant question because it determines the like-
lihood of the review being published and the impact it will have on the
research community. Conducting a literature review is hard work, so
the topic must be one that is of interest to both the author and reader.
Therefore, it is a good idea to scan the area as a ﬁrst step to account for
other literature reviews that already exist, to assess the number of re-
search studies that must be assessed, and to help formulate and clearly
deﬁne the purpose, scope, and speciﬁc research question the review will
address. These are important actions because they will help to identify
which approach is most appropriate. For example, if the review aims to
summarize or evaluate a large ﬁeld of research or even several research
areas, a strict systematic review approach may not be suitable or even
possible. Instead, a narrative or integrative review approach would be
preferable. In the same way, if the purpose of the review is to in-
vestigate and synthesize evidence of the eﬀect of a speciﬁc factor, an
integrative review is not trustworthy; instead, a systematic review ap-
proach should be used. The stated purpose should then guide the rest of
the review.

Once the research question has been identiﬁed and an overall

Journal of Business Research 104 (2019) 333–339

review approach considered, a search strategy for identifying relevant
literature must be developed. This includes selecting search terms and
appropriate databases and deciding on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Here, a number of important decisions must be made that are crucial
and will eventually determine the quality and rigor of the review.
Search terms can be words or phrases used to access appropriate arti-
cles, books, and reports. These terms should be based on words and
concepts that are directly related to the research question. Depending
on the aim of the review and the research question, these search terms
can be broad or narrow. Importantly, it could be worthwhile to consider
including additional limitations.

initial

the most

As almost all

literature searches yield many articles, a
strategy is needed to identify which are actually relevant. Inclusion
criteria for the review should be guided by the selected research
question. Criteria that can be considered and are commonly used are,
for example, year of publication, language of the article, type of article
(such as conceptual, randomized controlled trail, etc.), and journal. In
terms of research quality, deciding on inclusion and exclusion criteria is
one of
important steps when conducting your review.
However, important to note is the need to provide reasoning and
transparency concerning all choices made; there must be logical and
valid motives. This is important, as, independent of the type of ap-
proach, the quality of the literature is dependent on, among other as-
pects, what literature is included and how it was selected (Tranﬁeld
et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2013). Depending on these decisions, a study
can end up with very diﬀerent answers and conclusions to the same
research questions. For example, by only selecting some speciﬁc jour-
nals, years, or even search terms to try to limit your search, you can end
up with a very ﬂawed or skewed sample and missing studies that would
have been relevant to your case or even contradict other studies. You
can also come to the wrong conclusion about gaps in the literature, or
perhaps more serious, provide false evidence of a speciﬁc eﬀect. A
practical approach is to write all decisions down to enable transpar-
ency, as the authors must be clear in a way that enables the reader to
understand how the literature was identiﬁed, analyzed, synthesized,
and reported. This should be done carefully and prior to actually con-
ducting the review.

3.2. Phase 2: conducting the review

After deciding on the purpose, speciﬁc research questions, and type
of approach, it is time to start conducting the actual review. When
conducting the review, a pilot test of the review process and protocol is
appropriate. By testing the search terms and inclusion criteria on a
smaller sample, the process can be adjusted before performing the main
review. It is common to adjust the process a number of times before
actually selecting the ﬁnal sample. Importantly, it should be noted that
it is preferred to use two reviewers to select articles to ensure the
quality and reliability of the search protocol.

The actual selection of the sample can be done in a number of ways,
depending on the nature and scope of the speciﬁc review. Depending on
how many articles are yielded, diﬀerent approaches will be appro-
priate. For example, reviewers may read each piece of literature that
appears in the search in full; this is a highly useful, but time-consuming
approach. Another option could be to focus on the research method or
ﬁndings, and a third option is to conduct the review in stages by reading
abstracts ﬁrst and making selections and then reading full-text articles
later, before making the ﬁnal selection. Once this is done and the initial
articles (or other relevant literature) have been collected, the texts
should be screened in full to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. As
an additional strategy, references in the selected articles can be scanned
to identify other articles that may potentially be relevant (however, this
is not appropriate when using the systematic review method as this
requires a more strict protocol). During this time, the process of in-
cluding and excluding speciﬁc articles should be documented carefully.

337

3.3. Phase 3: analysis

After conducting the literature review and deciding on a ﬁnal
sample, it is important to consider how the articles will be used to
conduct an appropriate analysis. That is, after selecting a ﬁnal sample, a
standardized means of abstracting appropriate information from each
article should be used. Data abstracted can be in the form of descriptive
information, such as authors, years published, topic, or type of study, or
in the form of eﬀects and ﬁndings. It can also take the form of con-
ceptualizations of a certain idea or theoretical perspective. Importantly,
this should be done in concordance with the purpose and research
question of the speciﬁc review, and the form will vary. In this step, it is
important to consider training the reviewers to avoid any diﬀerences in
coding and abstraction (if there is more than one) and monitoring the
data abstraction carefully during the review process to ensure quality
and reliability. Often, if the aim is to publish in an academic journal,
this will require a detailed description of the process or a measure of
reliability between reviewers. Sometimes this is easy, if the information
of interest is, for example, population, eﬀect size, or sample size.
However, it becomes harder when the information of interest is themes
in the literature, perspectives, or providing an historical timeline.

Depending on the review, diﬀerent analysis methods can be used
and are more or less appropriate (please see above for diﬀerent con-
tributions from diﬀerent approaches). Nevertheless, independent of the
method of analysis, it is important to ensure that it is appropriate to
answer the selected research question. For example, if the purpose is to
evaluate evidence of the eﬀect of loyalty programs, the use of a meta-
analysis is most appropriate. On the other hand, if the purpose was to
develop a theoretical model or framework for customer experience, a
strict meta-analysis would be a poor choice; rather, an analysis tech-
nique suitable for integrative reviews should be used.

3.4. Phase 4: writing the review

First, when writing the review, the motivation and need for the
review must be clearly communicated. Depending on the approach, the
ﬁnal review article can be structured in diﬀerent ways, and it will re-
quire diﬀerent types of information and diﬀerent levels of detail. A
number of standards and guidelines explicitly address how literature
reviews should be reported and structured, including PRISMA, devel-
oped for systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses (see Liberati
et al., 2009); RAMSES, developed for systematic narrative reviews (see
Wong et al., 2013); and guidelines for integrative reviews (Torraco,
2005). Although review articles can be organized in various ways, some
generalizations can be made. All authors are expected to follow ac-
cepted conventions for reporting on how the study was undertaken. It is
necessary to describe transparently the process of designing the review
and the method for collecting literature, that is, how the literature was
identiﬁed, analyzed, synthesized, and reported by the author. Doing so
properly gives the reader the chance to assess the quality and trust-
worthiness of the ﬁndings. The contribution of the speciﬁc literature
review can take a number of forms, and it should be judged in re-
lationship to the ﬁeld to which it wants to contribute. Depending on a
number of factors, such as the maturity of the ﬁeld or state of knowl-
edge, diﬀerent contributions could be valuable. For example, literature
reviews can result in a historical analysis of the development within a
research ﬁeld (e.g. Carlborg, Kindström, & Kowalkowski, 2014), an
agenda for further research (e.g., McColl-Kennedy et al., 2017), a
conceptual model or categorization (e.g., Snyder et al., 2016; Witell
et al., 2016), or evidence of an eﬀect (e.g., Verlegh & Steenkamp,
1999).

4. Assessing the quality of a literature review

Literature reviews need to be assessed and evaluated as strictly as
empirical articles, but is this always the case? Palmatier et al. (2018)

suggest that a quality literature review must have both depth and rigor,
that is, it needs to demonstrate an appropriate strategy for selecting
articles and capturing data and insights and to oﬀer something beyond
a recitation of previous research. In addition, they state that a quality
literature review needs to be replicable, that is, the method must be
described such that an external reader could replicate the study and
reach similar ﬁndings. Lastly, they state that a literature review must be
useful for scholars and practitioners. However, evaluating diﬀerent
types of literature reviews can be challenging. Therefore, some guide-
lines for eventuating literature review articles across approaches are
suggested as a starting point to help editors, reviewers, authors, and
readers evaluating literature reviews (summarized in Table 4). These
depart from the diﬀerent stages of conducting a literature review and
should be broad enough to encompass most types of literature reviews.
However, of importance is that when evaluating an individual review,
speciﬁc standards for the type of review must be examined to assess
whether the review meets the criteria for rigor and depth. Depending
on if, it is a systematic, semi-systematic or integrative review, diﬀerent
standards can be valid. However, independent of type of review, pay
close attention to what studies have been included and for what reasons
as these decisions make all the diﬀerences in terms of what type of
conclusions the authors reach. Ignoring a relevant ﬁeld of research,
some journals or years can have major consequences for the results and
conclusions of the studies. In addition, its contribution should always be
evaluated against the topic or ﬁeld to which it adds. What constitutes a
useful contribution in one area may be insuﬃcient in another.

5. How to get your literature review published

While there are many arguments in favor for conducting a literature
review, publishing it can be challenging. Several common mistakes are

338

made by researchers when conducting a literature review that can
hinder it from getting anywhere near publication in a decent journal.
First, researchers often fail to describe in enough detail how the lit-
erature review was conducted, which makes it impossible to evaluate
both the quality of the review and its contribution. These reviews often
fail to provide details of the overall research strategy, the selection and
exclusion of articles, the limitations of the search method, and the
quality of the search process, and they often lack details on how the
analysis was conducted. Second, in the eagerness to pare the sample
size down to make the review easier to handle, it is also common to
limit the search too greatly. This can be done by only including a
limited number of journals and a narrow year span or excluding articles
from related ﬁelds that could have been relevant for the speciﬁc review.
Limiting the sample too greatly is a warning ﬂag, as it aﬀects both the
depth and rigor of the review, and it can have serious eﬀects on its
results and contributions. A better way to handle too many samples is to
re-consider and narrow down the research question. Of course, some-
times it can be perfectly ﬁne to limit the sample in diﬀerent ways, but
good reasons for doing so must be provided. Third, frequently, re-
searchers who have conducted a review often fail to present and explain
the results of the review clearly. Often, a large number of diﬀerent
graphs, tables, and ﬁgures is included, but not remarked on or ex-
plained. This makes it challenging to understand what they really mean
or what was actually found. It is common to spend much time ex-
plaining the method and the speciﬁc analytical technique, but to spend
less time discussing and explaining what was actually found and what
these results mean. This is true for both advanced quantitative and
qualitative analyses. Failing to put the results in context makes it pro-
blematic to judge the contributions of the article.

Lastly, perhaps the most common mistake is that literature reviews
often fail to provide a truly valuable contribution to the ﬁeld. No matter
how excellent and rigorous the review article, if it does not provide
enough of a contribution, something that is new, it will not be pub-
lished. Too often, literature reviews are simply descriptive summaries
of research conducted between certain years, describing such in-
formation as the number of articles published, topics covered, citations
analyzed, authors represented, and perhaps methods used, without
conducting any deeper analysis. While there are likely times when this
can be valuable, this is not usually the case and they are not likely to be
published in any journal. In truth, review articles that are a medley of
word clouds and citation analyses are highly unlikely to be published.
This is a pity, as these researchers have gone through the tedious work
of collecting many articles without actually analyzing them in any
meaningful way, and because of this, they fail to make a signiﬁcant
contribution.

Yet, there are ways of moving beyond simply summarizing the lit-
erature and truly developing something that is new and valuable and
create a substantial contribution to the ﬁeld in question. First, there is
of course a need to use a good research methodology that ﬁlls the
quality criteria for conducting literature reviews, but features or ana-
lyses can also be added to make the review paper more likely to stand
out. There are many examples of articles that have been successfully
published in higher-ranked business journals using a literature review
strategy as a basis. Not accounting for the quality of the review itself,
there seems to be a number of ways forward. One such way is to con-
duct a literature review and combine it with a meta-analysis of a re-
levant topic to provide some evidence of eﬀect. This strategy has been
used eﬀectively in articles published in higher-ranked journals (e.g.,
Carrillat et al., 2018; Edeling & Himme, 2018; Verlegh & Steenkamp,
1999). Important to note is that simply conducting a meta-analysis does
not warrant publication; it must also focus on a topic that is relevant, is
interesting, and solves some type of research dilemma, thereby ad-
vancing the knowledge in the ﬁeld. In addition, reviews that build on
computer-based text analysis and machine learning have been receiving
increased interest in business research (e.g., Antons & Breidbach, 2018;
Witell et al., 2016). While text analysis may well be an excellent way to

H. Snyder

Journal of Business Research 104 (2019) 333–339

contribute, simply using these types of techniques is not enough if it is
not done properly and with a purpose in mind. Often, text analysis
approaches end up being highly descriptive, only providing an over-
view of topics, themes, or networks and not generating any deeper
analysis. As an alternative, a valuable output from these types of ana-
lyses can for example creating a timeline for analyzing and predicting
where a ﬁeld is heading, a comparison of diﬀerent related terms or
constructs that can serve as a base for theory development or identi-
fying true knowledge gaps in previous research.

Although rare, still highly desirable is a well-executed literature
review that provides a new theory or includes a well-grounded sub-
stantial research agenda or propositions on which other researchers can
build to advance the ﬁeld (e.g., Boyd & Solarino, 2016; Mazumdar
et al., 2005; Rodell, Breitsohl, Schröder, & Keating, 2016). While this
type of analysis is often time-consuming and requires strong analytical
skills from the researchers, if successful, it can make a great contribu-
tion to the speciﬁc ﬁeld of research.

Note that the examples above are only a few of many pathways to
making a contribution using literature review as a research method.
However, it is very challenging to try to create a contribution when you
have already collected the data (published material) and try to turn this
into a publishable article. Therefore, it is important to have a particular
research question in mind from the beginning and to ensure the right
approach is chosen to solve the research problem at hand.

6. Summary and conclusion

Literature reviews play an important role as a foundation for all
types of research. They can serve as a basis for knowledge development,
create guidelines for policy and practice, provide evidence of an eﬀect,
and, if well conducted, have the capacity to engender new ideas and
directions for a particular ﬁeld. As such, they serve as the grounds for
future research and theory. However, both conducting a literature re-
view and evaluating its quality can be challenging, which is why this
paper oﬀers some simple guidelines on how to conduct better, more
rigorous literature reviews and, in the long run, simply better research.
If there is certainty that the research is built on great accuracy, it will be
much easier to identify actual research gaps instead of simply con-
ducting the same research repeatedly, to develop better and more
precise hypotheses and research questions, and, therefore, to increase
the quality of research as a community.
